# SFML Premake5 Template
For ease of use generating a solution for VS2022

## Getting Started
Once you've cloned, you can customize the `premake5.lua` to your liking (eg. change the name from "sfml_project" to something else).  Once you're happy, run `build-project.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files.
